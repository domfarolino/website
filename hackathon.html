		<p>During the fall of 2016 I was on the organizing team for RevolutionUC, the University of Cincinnati's student-run hackathon. For anyone who might not know what a hackathon is, it is a chance for students everywhere to get together and make something. They are typically 24 hour events in which students form teams, come up with a "hack," and build a working prototype to demo to judges. RevolutionUC is completely free for students, and we provide snacks, meals, swag, and prizes. This of course requires funding, mainly through corporate sponsorship, which is where I fit in.</p>
		<p>I was on the sponsorship committee with two other organizers, and our goal was to raise $12,000 for this event. Between the three of us, we ended up raising $21,000, nearly doubling our goal. My job was to reach out to contacts at various companies and describe what RevolutionUC is and what hackathons are, and ask if they'd like to get involved. I was their contact for all monetary questions and questions about the benefits of sponsorship and most day-of details.</p>
		<p>I made a lot of connections through this experience and learned a lot about professional communication and fundraising. It was a very beneficial experience for me, as I do not get a lot of that type of communication experience through my coursework.</p>
