    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="main-body">
   	 <p>My name is Laura Tebben and I am a third year studying computer science at the University of Cincinnati, set to graduate in 2019. I am a 4.0 student and a member of the University Honors Program. I am involved in ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), and am working with them to organize the next RevolutionUC Hackathon.</p> 
  	  <p>I love coding, cats, traveling, and spending time with friends. In my free time I work on personal programming projects, including creating a slider puzzle in Java and doing the NSA codebreaker challenge. I am a co-op at Siemens PLM Software, where I do development and quality assurance for the drafting department of their CAD software, NX. During class semesters, I am a TA for Models I and Models II, which were my favorite classes freshman year.</p>
  	  <p>I am excited about all the opportunities UC has to offer. Co-op has been a great experience, and I am considering doing ACCEND. With a masters and co-op under my belt, I have very high hopes for my future. While I'm still not 100% sure where I want to end up, I know I'd love to be a software engineer for a cutting-edge tech company.</p>
